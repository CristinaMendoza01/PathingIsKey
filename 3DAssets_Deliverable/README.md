# 3D Assets Deliverable

Our videogame is called Pathing Is Key. 

The environment consists in a grass floor, two stone platforms, one with some elements (lava, water, a pickaxe adn two buckets) and the other one with a ruby reward.

The sounds we will use are also in a folder called Sounds inside the Assets folder.
