# Pathing Is Key

This is the GitHub Repository where we will upload our project of the Interactive Systems course, called Pathing Is Key.
This project consists in a collaborative videogame where two children, between 8 and 12 years old, have to cooperate to build a stone path until a ruby reward by avoiding different obstacles.

# Implementations

- Different tags for different elements.
- Movement is only allowed on the Stone and When the player tries to leave the controller won't let it
- Mechanics to pick the bucket and the pickaxe based on collisions.
- Mechanics for the buckets to pick either lava or water.
- Mechanics for the pickaxe to destroy stone, this has been implemented with a Raycast and calculating the direction of the player (for now the destroy button is R). The Pickaxe also Rotates with the player.
- Sounds for the bucket picking water or the pickaxe breaking stone have also been added.
- These mechanics have not been tested for the trackers, these are tests for when they're off. Later they'll be tested and modified to work with the trackers.
