# Pathing Is Key

This is the GitHub Repository where we will upload our project of the Interactive Systems course, called Pathing Is Key.
This project consists in a collaborative videogame where two children, between 8 and 12 years old, have to cooperate to build a stone path until a ruby reward by avoiding different obstacles.
